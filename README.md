# Images-and-Networks

Images and Networks is basically a repository of deep learning explorations and mini projects. It is a journey of my deep learning experiences
with images and networks.<br>

*Current implementations:* 
1. Currently it contains a mini project - a simple project to detect my mood looking at the facial image - In progress
2. A digit recognizer implemented in 3 stages, i.e. first with a simple network, then a deep network, and finally a convolutional network - to see the accuracy improvement at every transition
3. An autoencoder implemented from the keras blog: (Autoencoder)[https://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html]
4. A simple implementation of the cifar100 classification, that currently needs a lot of improvement.
5.
